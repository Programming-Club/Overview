### Below are links to the language installations:
- [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/platform/)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)


### Online sources we will be using:
- [Haskell Book](http://learnyouahaskell.com/introduction)
- [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html)


### Text editors for coding in Rust and Haskell
I personally like VS Code but any will do:
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/download.php) *If your feeling up to the challenge*


### Git Instillation
I *highly recommend* you learn how to use Git Bash since it is industry standard. But either will work...
- [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)


### Git Bash helpful links:
- [Git Bash Cheat Sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)
- [Git definitions](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary)
- [Installation Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Clau1bYco) Its a bit lengthy but will teach you the basics

### Some basic Git Bash Advice:
I recommend you create a GitHub folder on your pc to store all github repositories.

- To open Git Bash on windows right click and hit "open Git Bash here"
- To clone a repository got to the Github website and find the repo. Hit the clone button and copy the link then in Git Bash type:
```shell
git clone [Repo Name]
```

- To pull changes cd to the repository and type:
```shell
git pull
```

- To commit changes cd to the repository and type:
```shell
git commit -am"Your comment here"
```

- To push changes to a repository (After you committed) type:
```shell
git push
```


### Basic shell commands (Use Mac commands for when in Git Bash)
- To view all folders in the current directory type:
Mac/Linux
```shell
ls
```
Windows
```shell
dir
```

- To move to a sub directory type:
```shell
cd DirectoryNameHere
```

- To move back a directory type:
```shell
cd .. 
```
